# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

Click to visit the Belly button Biodiversity interactive dashboard: https://katiuscaq.github.io/Belly-Button-Biodiversity/

## Overview
Help Roza to complete the panel for demographic information and to create charts to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Her goal is that each volunteer should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Objectives and goals
1. Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
2. Create a Bubble Chart
3. Create a Gauge Chart
4. Customize the Dashboard

## Results
### 1. Horizontal Bar Chart:
After the volunteers select their ID number, the bar chart will portray in a descending order the top 10 bacteria that a volunteer has in his/her belly button.
Following an image of how the bar chart looked in the making and upgrading of the dashboard:

### 2. Bubble Chart:
In this chart the volunteer will have the chance to visually appreciate the different amounts of each bacteria in his/her belly button. The bubbles vary based on the quantity of each bacteria found in the volunteer's sample. With the hovermode property when the volunteer hover over the bubbles each bubble will provide information about that bacteria.

### 3. Gauge Chart:
This chart displays the weekly washing frequency's value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

### 4. Customized Dashboard:
The customizations are as follow:

In the following image changes are shown with pointers, explanation of each change is below the image:

`Pointer # 1`
The upgrades made in this area of the dashboard were:
- An image was added to the jumbotron.
- The image in the jumbotron was added and edited in the style.css file and one change from the original image is the opacity added to it.
- The font color of the header of the page was changed to be more visually appealing and to match the background image.

`Pointer # 2`
A paragraph was added to indicate to the volunteers that after selecting their ID number from the dropdown menu they will find information about the top 10 bacteria in their belly buttons.

`Pointer # 3`
The gauge chart fits in the margin of the \<div\> element, and the colors were selected to match the bubble chart colorscale and the gauge color was changed from black to lightgrey because it was more visually appealing.
  
Other change made to the dashboard was the size of the dropdown menu, a larger menu seems to fit the "well" better than the one originally. Images below show the before and after:

### Challenge encountered in the customization of the dashboard
There was one challenge that could not be met when customizing the dashboard, and it was to change the color of the bar chart to make it match the other charts.
